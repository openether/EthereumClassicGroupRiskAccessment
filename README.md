# EthereumClassicGroupRiskAccessment

http://ethereumclassic.org gets a D security rating for security headers, just going to the site gives your
data to everyone from facebook, twitter, reddit, random Netherlands advertisers. 

They have NO RESPECT for you or your privacy, they have no ability to protect that website to ensure the clients are safe
**meanwhile they bitch about blue accidently leaving bins in a project that they could compile and checksum AND KNOW THERE
IS NO MALWARE WITHOUT QUESTION.** So either they are too dumb to know that would have been that easy to check, or they are deliberately spreading lies to try to discredit anyone who obviously has more merit, and would rank higher in a meritocracy that they claim to support. There was also a .gitignore file, it was an obvious oversight and we can't even defend
ourselves. 

This is not even getting into the fact that the site is vulnerable other attacks. THE SOURCE OF OUR WALLETS FOR THE PUBLIC IS VASTLY INSECURE AND THEY ARE DOING NOTHING BUT SHUTTING DOWN DISCUSSION. 

They are not just a risk to Ethereum Classic, they are a direct threat. Their project MUST be stopped.

Their explorer has MAJOR security vulnerabilities and when I warned them, I wasn't even spoken to, I was immediately
removed from the group. So If anything their is reason to believe they are trying to leverage malware for their benefit
if anyone is. That is supposed to be meritocracy? That is offensive to even suggest, you clearly got a little power, and it has went to everyone involved heads and they ALL NEED TO BE REMOVED. 

We need to start the discussion of how to shut down that project, shutdown people claiming roles they have no ability
to fulfill because its a danger to the entire community and will hurt everyone long as they care more about the little
power they got, than the actual state of the project.
