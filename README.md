# EthereumClassicGroupRiskAccessment

http://ethereumclassic.org gets a D security rating for security headers, just going to the site gives your
data to everyone from facebook, twitter, reddit, random Netherlands advertisers. 

They have NO RESPECT for you or your privacy, they have no ability to protect that website to ensure the clients are safe
meanwhile they bitch about blue accidently leaving bins in a project that they could compile and checksum AND KNOW THERE
IS NO MALWARE WITHOUT QUESTION. THere was also a .gitignore file, it was an obvious oversight and we can't even defend
ourselves. 

They are not just a risk to Ethereum Classic, they are a direct threat. Their project MUST be stopped.

Their explorer has MAJOR security vulnerabilities and when I warned them, I wasn't even spoken to, I was immediately
removed from the group. So If anything their is reason to believe they are trying to leverage malware for their benefit
if anyone is. 

We need to start the discussion of how to shut down that project, shutdown people claiming roles they have no ability
to fulfill because its a danger to the entire community and will hurt everyone long as they care more about the little
power they got, than the actual state of the project.
